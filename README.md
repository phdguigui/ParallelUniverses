# CPU 🖥️

The CPU is responsible for executing, processing, and computing tasks, programs, and processes using threads. As mentioned by Rainer Stropek ([I strongly recommend you to watch this professor's classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIZVKteEFyk)), it is now common to use a single-core server for web hosting. For example, with a CPU that has 4 cores, you can divide these 4 cores into 4 different virtual machines, each with 1 core, allowing you to run more virtual machines. But how does the CPU execute processes? There are several methods for doing so, which are explained below.

## Multicore 🧑‍🔬

When you have a machine with multiple CPU cores, you can execute multiple processes **literally at the same time**. Think of each CPU core as a worker and the CPU as a factory. With multiple workers, you can have multiple processes running simultaneously. Each worker operates independently, and the processes do not depend on each other.

### Parallelism 🔄

Parallelism is based on the concept of multicore systems, where you can execute multiple processes on different CPU cores. For example, if you have 4 processes running on your machine, you can assign each one to a different core, allowing them to run independently of one another.

## Single-core 🕹️

It’s easy to understand how a machine executes multiple processes with a multicore CPU, but how is this possible with only one CPU core? This is where the concept of **concurrency** comes into play.

### Concurrent Execution ⏳

When there's only one core to execute multiple processes, it might seem impossible to do so. However, this method of execution is more common than you think. With a single core, the CPU rapidly switches between processes, giving the impression that they are running in parallel. However, each process is executed in its own time slice, making use of the CPU at different moments. You could say that processes "compete" for CPU time.

# Threads 🧵

A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. While a process is an instance of a program being executed, a thread represents a single path of execution within that process. Threads are often referred to as "lightweight processes" because they share the same memory space and resources as their parent process, unlike independent processes, which have their own memory space. In modern computing, threads allow for more efficient use of resources, enabling the concurrent execution of tasks within a process.

## Multithreading 🔀

Multithreading is the ability of a CPU (or a single core) to manage multiple threads simultaneously. This is achieved by breaking down a larger task into smaller sub-tasks that can run independently of one another, leading to more efficient processing. In a multithreaded application, different threads can execute different parts of the program concurrently, improving the overall performance of the system.

Although each thread runs sequentially within a process, a system can switch between threads so quickly (via **context switching**) that it appears they are executing simultaneously. This is especially important on systems with a single-core CPU, where true parallelism isn’t possible, but the illusion of concurrency is maintained through rapid switching between threads.

In summary, threads are essential components in modern computing, enabling processes to execute multiple tasks either **simultaneously** or **concurrently**. Whether on a single-core or multicore CPU, threads improve the performance and responsiveness of applications, making them a fundamental part of multitasking systems.

## Thread Pool 🔄💡

A **thread pool** is a collection of pre-instantiated, reusable threads that can be used to perform a set of tasks concurrently. Instead of creating a new thread for every individual task—which can be resource-intensive and inefficient—a thread pool allows tasks to be assigned to available threads within the pool. Once a thread finishes executing a task, it returns to the pool, ready to handle new tasks.

This approach reduces the overhead of thread creation and destruction, improving performance and resource management. Thread pools are especially useful in applications that need to handle many short-lived tasks, such as server applications and web services. Using a thread pool optimizes throughput and scalability in concurrent programming environments.

### When to Create a New Thread vs. Use a Thread Pool 🤔

You should create a new thread when a task is unique, long-running, or requires specific resources that cannot be shared efficiently with other tasks. However, for tasks that are **short-lived**, repetitive, or can be shared across multiple invocations, using a thread from a thread pool is more efficient. 🏃‍♂️💨

# .NET Examples 💻🔧

## 1. **Multicore and Parallelism (Using Multiple Cores) 🖥️⚙️**

In C#, you can leverage multiple cores through parallel programming, especially using the `Parallel` class. This allows you to execute multiple tasks simultaneously across available CPU cores. 

```csharp
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

Parallel.ForEach(numbers, (number) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Processing number {number} on thread {System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
});
```

For example, `Parallel.ForEach` can be used to process a collection of data concurrently, where each task can be executed on a different core, improving performance by dividing the work among available cores.

## 2. **Single-core and Concurrent Execution 🔄**

In single-core machines, multiple tasks can be executed concurrently, but not truly in parallel. The CPU quickly switches between tasks, giving the illusion of parallelism. This is achieved through multithreading.

```csharp
static async Task Main()
{
    // Simulating concurrent execution with async/await on a single core
    Task task1 = Task.Run(() => DoWork("Task 1"));
    Task task2 = Task.Run(() => DoWork("Task 2"));

    await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2);
}

static async Task DoWork(string taskName)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{taskName} started on thread {System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
    await Task.Delay(1000);  // Simulate async work
    Console.WriteLine($"{taskName} finished on thread {System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
}
```

The `async` and `await` keywords allow for non-blocking concurrency. Even on a single-core CPU, tasks appear to run concurrently, thanks to rapid context switching between them.

## 3. **Multithreading and Thread Creation 🧵💻**

Creating threads manually is useful when you need full control over the thread, especially for long-running or resource-specific tasks. You can manually create a new thread using the `Thread` class and start it to perform a specific task.

```csharp
static void Main()
{
    // Creating a new thread to run a task
    Thread newThread = new Thread(() => DoWork("New Thread"));
    newThread.Start();

    Console.ReadLine();
}

static void DoWork(string threadName)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{threadName} started on thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
    Thread.Sleep(1000);  // Simulate work
    Console.WriteLine($"{threadName} finished on thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
}
```

This approach is beneficial when tasks are resource-intensive or need to run independently of others. However, manually managing threads can be inefficient compared to using a thread pool for short-lived tasks.

## 4. **Thread Pool 🏊‍♂️🔄**

Thread pools are great for executing many short-lived tasks concurrently. The thread pool reuses threads instead of creating new ones, improving efficiency and resource usage. Instead of creating new threads for every task, tasks are assigned to available threads from the pool.

```csharp
static void Main()
{
    // Queuing a task to the thread pool
    ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem((state) => DoWork("Thread Pool Task"));

    Console.ReadLine();
}

static void DoWork(string taskName)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{taskName} started on thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
    Thread.Sleep(1000);  // Simulate work
    Console.WriteLine($"{taskName} finished on thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
}
```

Thread pools are ideal for scenarios like server applications and web services where many tasks need to be executed quickly and concurrently, reducing the overhead of thread creation.

## 5. **Task Parallel Library (Task.Run) 🏃‍♂️💨**

`Task.Run` provides an easy way to run tasks concurrently using the thread pool. It's ideal for performing background work without blocking the main thread, especially in scenarios where you need non-blocking behavior such as UI applications.

```csharp
static void Main()
{
    // Running tasks using the thread pool through Task.Run
    Task.Run(() => DoWork("Background Task"));

    Console.WriteLine("Main thread continues to execute while the background task runs...");
    Console.ReadLine();
}

static void DoWork(string taskName)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{taskName} started on thread {System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
    Task.Delay(1000).Wait();  // Simulate async work
    Console.WriteLine($"{taskName} finished on thread {System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
}
```

By using `Task.Run`, you can offload tasks to the thread pool, which helps improve responsiveness and performance. Tasks executed this way are automatically managed by the framework, removing the need to manually create and manage threads.

## 6. **Using `async` and `await` for Asynchronous Execution ⏳🔄**

The `async` modifier allows methods to execute asynchronously. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, such as reading from a file or making network requests, without blocking the main thread. `async` methods work in combination with `await` to keep the program responsive while tasks are completed in the background.

```csharp
static async Task Main()
{
    // Calling an asynchronous method
    await PerformAsyncTask();

    Console.WriteLine("Main thread continues after async task.");
}

static async Task PerformAsyncTask()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Async task started.");
    await Task.Delay(2000);  // Simulate async work
    Console.WriteLine("Async task finished.");
}
```

With `async` and `await`, tasks can be paused until a result is ready, but they don't block other operations from continuing.

# Conclusion 🌟

In summary, process and thread management is essential for the efficiency and performance of modern systems. The use of multiple cores (parallelism) allows for the simultaneous execution of tasks, while concurrent execution on single-core machines is possible through techniques like rapid context switching between processes and threads. **Multithreading** allows a process to be broken down into smaller subtasks, improving resource utilization and system performance, especially in scenarios with many short tasks.

Choosing between creating new threads or using a thread pool depends on the nature of the tasks. For short and repetitive tasks, thread pools are more efficient, while for long-running tasks or those requiring specific resources, manually creating threads might be necessary. Additionally, the use of `async` and `await` enables asynchronous execution, optimizing I/O-bound operations without blocking the main process, keeping the application responsive. ⚡

Understanding these techniques and when to apply them can have a significant impact on the performance and scalability of systems, especially in high-demand environments like servers and web services. 🌐🚀
